      <h3>Our team</h3>
	  <p>We are a small team of engineers focused on the application of technology in the Data Processing, Data Integration and Business Intelligence domains.</p>
	  <p>Our industry backgrounds include Investment Banking, Insurance and Telecommunications</p>
	  <p>Our aim is to simplify Data Processing & Data Integration to a level where low skilled IT staff will be able to deliver IT projects without trade-off in elegance, simplicity and most importantly performance of the applications.</p>
	  <p>The ability to deliver on such ambitious objectives comes from in depth experience gained from the numerous Data Warehousing & Data Integration projects that we have been part of.</p>

      <h3>The Problem</h3>
	  <p>Data Integration can typically be characterized as a set of large (in numbers), highly coupled and moderately complex units of ETL transformations/code. This translates as 'high complexity' for the majority of Data Integration, Business Intelligence and Data Processing projects.</p>
	  <p>Data Processing commonly faces performance issues, long load times, SLA breaks and long processing windows as a consequence of batch oriented rather than real time (low latency) design paradigms & thinking.</p>
	  <p>Business Intelligence users often require much smaller query latencies from the ones delivered.</p>

      <h3>Our Response</h3>
      <p>We have created generic platform which is simple to setup and deliver. Time to market of project delivery is being measured in days rather than months. Skills required for delivery are reduced to the basics of IT knowledge.</p>
	  <p>We have delivered an ETL platform, which eliminates performance issues even for volumes typical only of Financial Exchanges, Time Series Analysis & Real Time Risk Valuations. Desktop computers running our platform have more processing bandwidth than server hardware with state of the art (read complex and expensive) ETL tools running on dozens of CPUâ€™s.</p>
	  <p>The performance of our platform (throughput measured in millions of records per second) allows database experts to index their Data Mart to an extent previously unimaginable (4+ indexes per single fact table) while still having real time ETL processing in place.</p>
	  <p>Ability to rapidly load data into database further simplifies the Business Intelligence stack by eliminating the need to have MOLAP or other alternatives acting as query accelerators behind their relational databases (aggregate tables or equivalents). The reduction in complexity results in reduced implementation and hardware costs whilst delivery a highly maintainable and supportable system</p>
      <p>By bringing together simplicity of implementation (by reducing development to simple customisation) and processing performance we aim to make impact in Data Processing & Data Integration IT Industry.</p>
