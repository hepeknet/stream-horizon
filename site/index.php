      <h5>Complexity</h5>
      <div class="sepmini"></div>
      <p>
	   Data Integration can typically be characterised as a set of large (in numbers), interdependent and usually trivial units of ETL transformations/code. </p>
	  <p> 
	   Above stated spells ‘high complexity’ for majority of Data Integration, Business Intelligence and Data Processing projects.
	  </p>

    <article class="column3 mright services">
      
      <h5>Performance</h5>
      <div class="sepmini"></div>
      <p>Data Processing commonly faces performance issues, long load times, SLA breaks, long processing windows. Consequence of batch oriented rather than real time (low latency) design paradigms & thinking.</p>
    </article>
    <article class="column3 services">
     
      <h5>Query Latency</h5>
      <div class="sepmini"></div>
      <p>Business Intelligence users often require much smaller query latencies from the ones delivered.</p>

    <article class="column3 mright services">
      <p>We have created generic platform which is simple to setup and deliver. </p>
	  <p>Time to market of project delivery is being measured in day(s) rather than months. </p>
	  <p>Skills required for delivery are reduced almost to the one of common sense and truly basic 101 IT knowledge.</p>
    </article>
    <article class="column3 mright services">
      <p>We have delivered highly performing ETL platform, which eliminates performance issues even for volumes typical only for Financial Exchanges, Time Series Analysis & Real Time Risk Valuations. </p>
	  <br>
	  <p>Desktops running on our platform have more processing bandwidth than commodity servers with state of the art (read complex and expensive) ETL tools and couple of dozens of CPU’s.</p>
    </article>
    <article class="column3 services">
      <p>Performance of our platform (throughput measured in millions of records per second) allows database experts to index their Data Mart to extent previously unimaginable (5+ indexes per single fact table) while still having real time ETL processing in place.</p>
	  <br>
	  <p>This ability further simplifies Business Intelligence stack by eliminating the need to have MOLAP or other alternatives acting as query accelerators behind their relational databases (aggregate tables or equivalents). </p>
	  <br>
	  <p>It also reduces complexity of the Business Intelligence stack and further reduces budget spend on hardware, licences and most importantly complexity of solution overall (reduction of man-day costs).</p>
