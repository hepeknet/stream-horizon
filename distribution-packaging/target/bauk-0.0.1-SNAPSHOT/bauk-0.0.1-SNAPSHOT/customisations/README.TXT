Dynamic customizations go here. Requirements:

1) JDK 1.7+ must be installed on the system and JAVA_HOME must point to installation directory
2) Customisations must be valid Java source files, with valid packages, imports etc.
3) Classpath must contain all imports in any customisation source file
4) Customisations must not be copied to folder hierarchy reflecting their package structure. Just leave them in the root of this directory
5) Customisations can be identified by their fully qualified Java name (including package name)
6) Customisations can be compiled and placed in one of jar files in the classpath, in which case they will be resolved from there instead of compiled from source code
